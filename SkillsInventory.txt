-My experience with .NET Web Development is pretty well tuned. I have been doing VB.Net for 3 years at Weber State 
University. I mainly work on the eWeber apps. I have worked on a couple of smaller personal projects at home
with my vb.net experience, but that sums up my .Net web experience.

-I have 11 credits registered this semester. I have the .Net capstone, Ruby, and cooperative work experience. I
also work 40 hours a week. My schedule will be quite busy but not as busy as previous semesters. I will make sure
I work with my job and my team to get group projects done. My only concern is making sure I can split up work evenly
with my group mates.

-In order for me to get up to speed I will watch all of the plural site videos, but that is a given for this course.
My further intent to get up to speed is to go on youtube and watch a couple more videos as well as making a couple
of smaller projects to utilize what I need to do later in this course. I can also contact professors, my friends, 
and other tutors for help if needed. I'll make sure I work on all of my weakpoints before the group work starts.
